# Medicinal-Plant-Classification-using-MobilenetV2
 
## Overview
This Medicinal Plant Classification App is developed as part of a research project. It uses the MobileNetV2 model to identify different types of medicinal plants. The model was trained on 30,000 images across 35 plant classes, plus 1 class for unknown plants. The app was built using Android Studio and works offline, offering a smooth and easy-to-use experience on mobile devices.

## Dataset
The model was trained and tested using a mix of publicly available and custom-collected datasets to ensure strong performance and good variety. The dataset includes:   - Training Set: 21,600 images
 - Validation Set: 3,960 images
 - Test Set: 1,980 images

## Preprocessing Techniques
* Image Resizing
* Data Augmentation (Random rotation and brightness)
* Normalization

## Performance Evaluation
The model was trained for more than 15 epochs and tested on a dataset of 1,980 images. The evaluation results are as follows:

## Adding Tensorflow Lite model in Android Studio
1. Go to app/src/main and look for the asset folder. If it does not exist, create it.
2. Copy the **model.tflite** into the assets folder.
3. Open **build.gradle.kts(Module:app)** and add **'this.implementation ("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.11.0")'** and **'this.implementation ("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-select-tf-ops:2.11.0")'** to the dependencies.
